# Conway's Game of Life

I developed this program as a course assignment when I was studying non-linear dynamics and chaos theory during my undergraduate studies.

The Game of Life, is a dynamical system represented by cellular automaton. There are 4 rules governing the system:
+ Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
+ Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
+ Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
+ Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
